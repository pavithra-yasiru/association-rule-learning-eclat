# Association Rule Learning - Eclat

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Association Rule Learning** using the **Eclat Algorithm** on the same market basket dataset (`Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`).  
The objective is to find frequent itemsets by focusing on item combinations.

## 📂 Files
- `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv` → Dataset containing customer transaction data.  
- `association_rule_learning_eclat.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook implementing the Eclat algorithm.  

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the required Python libraries before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Place the dataset and notebook in the same folder.  
3. Open the notebook and run all cells.  

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data Preprocessing (transactions transformation).  
- Applying **Eclat** to find frequent itemsets based on support.  
- Sorting itemsets to identify the most frequent item combinations.  

## 🔑 Insights
- Highlights the **most common product combinations**.  
- Useful for **market basket analysis** and **customer purchase behavior** studies.
